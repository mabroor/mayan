Version 0.12
------------
* Remove Celery from the requirements
* Statistics fixes
* Italian translation by SeeOpen.IT (www.seeopen.it, info@seeopen.it)

  migrations as it was causing error messages for MySQL users.

--------------

* Improves error detection when importing keys from a keyserver, catching
  the exception KeyImportError and not KeyFetchingError
* Fixes a wrong method call when verifying signatures for the first time upon document uploading
* django-compress is now disabled by default to avoid problems when deploying with DjangoZoom

Version 0.11
------------
* Support for signed documents verification added, embedded and detached
  signatures are supported.  When verifying a document Mayan EDMS will
  try to fetch the public key from the list of keyservers provided in the
  configuration option SIGNATURES_KEYSERVERS (which defaults to
  'pool.sks-keyservers.net').  A public key management view has been added
  to the setup menu as well as a key query and fetching view to manually
  import keys from a keyserver.
* Added support for document versions.  Users can upload unlimited amount
  of versions for a document using a very flexible document version numbering
  system, users can also revert to a previous document version.
* OCR queue processing improvements.
* Office documents handling improvements.
* Text extraction support for office documents.
* RTF text documents are now handled as office documents.
* Added a view to delete the document image cache, useful when switching
  converter backends or doing diagnostics.
* Added South to the requirements.
* Merged documents' filename and extension database fiels into a single
  filename field, filename are store as uploaded not manipulation is done
  Users with existing data must install South and run the appropiate
  migrate commands::
    $ pip install -r requirements/production.txt
    $ ./manager syncdb
    $ ./manage.py migrate documents 0001 --fake
    $ ./manage.py migrate documents
* Added new office document mimetype
    * application/vnd.ms-office
* Fixed documents not saving the file encoding
* Removed extra slash in ajax-loader.gif URL fixes #15, thanks to 
  IHLeanne for finding this one


Version 0.10.1
--------------
* Upgraded django-compressor to version 1.1.1, run::

  $ pip install --upgrade -r requirements/production.txt

  to upgrade
  
* django-compressor is now disabled by default, users must explicitly 
  enable it adding COMPRESS_ENABLED=True to their settings_local.py file


Version 0.10
------------
* Added a proper setup views for the document grouping functionality.
* Document grouping is now called smart linking as it relates better to
  how it actually works.  The data base schema was changed and users must
  do the required::

    $ ./manager syncdb

  for the new tables to be created.
* Grappelli is no longer required as can be uninstalled.
* New smarter document preview widget that doesn't allow zooming or viewing
  unknown or invalid documents.
* New office document converter, requires:

    * LibreOffice (https://www.libreoffice.org/)
    * unoconv [version 0.5] (https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv)

* The new office documents converter won't convert files with the extension 
  .docx because these files are recognized as zip files instead.  This 
  is an issue of the libmagic library.

* New configuration option added ``CONVERTER_UNOCONV_USE_PIPE`` that controls 
  how unoconv handles the communication with LibreOffice.  The default of 
  ``True`` causes unoconv to use **pipes**, this approach is slower than using 
  **TCP/IP** ports but it is more stable.
  
* Initial `REST` `API` that exposes documents properties and one method, this 
  new `API` is used by the new smart document widget and requires the 
  package ``djangorestframework``, users must issue a::
  
  $ pip install -r requirements/production.txt
  
  to install this new requirement.
  
* MIME type detection and caching performance updates.
* Updated the included version of ``jQuery`` to 1.7
* Updated the included version of ``JqueryAsynchImageLoader`` to 0.9.7
* Document image serving response now specifies a MIME type for increased 
  browser compatibility.
* Small change in the scheduler that increases stability.
* Russian translation updates (Сергей Глита [Sergey Glita])
* Improved and generalized the OCR queue locking mechanism, this should 
  eliminate any posibility of race conditions between Mayan EDMS OCR nodes.
* Added support for signals to the OCR queue, this results in instant OCR
  processing upon submittal of a document to the OCR queue, this works in
  addition to the current polling processing which eliminates the
  posibility of stale documents in the OCR queue.
* Added multiple document OCR submit link
* Re enabled tesseract language specific OCR processing and added a one
  (1) time language neutral retry for failed language specific OCR

Version 0.9.1
-------------
* Added handling percent encoded unicode query strings in search URL,
  thanks to (Сергей Глита [Sergei Glita]) for reporting.
* Added a FAQ explaing how to fix MySQL collation related error when
  doing searches also thanks to (Сергей Глита [Sergei Glita]) for
  reporting this one.
